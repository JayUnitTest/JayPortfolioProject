# FRONT-END Development Portfolio CTEC3905 ASSIGNMENT

# What is my project?
HI! Welcome to my Front-End development assignment :)

This project involved creating a portfolio website for myself as an upcoming graduate in Computer Science. 
Any developer needs to be able to show off their work to the wold and what better way to do that than a 
portfolio website!

# Why a portfolio?
-- include why, who is this for?, what this can be used for etc.. .
I chose the route of a personal portfolio as graduating from university i needed a way of showing my work 
to the world. In the modern world, a website is the easiest, most efficient way of doing this. 

This can be used by people in the industry who may be interested in taking me on in their work place.

# choices made?
- the decisions made during the development of this portfolio all focused on the most efficient way i could 
create the portfolio. This is because a portfolio although needs to demonstrate ability, i also did not want to make it overly complex. In the future, i will consider updating this to correctly display my ability as it develops.
